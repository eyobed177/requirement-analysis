## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, and documenting the functional and non-functional needs of a software system. It acts as the foundation of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) by ensuring that the final product meets the expectations of its stakeholders.

During this phase, communication between stakeholders—such as clients, users, business analysts, and developers—is critical. The goal is to understand *what* the system should do and *why* it is needed before any design or development begins.

### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis:
- **Elicitation**: Collecting requirements through interviews, surveys, observations, and document analysis.
- **Analysis**: Evaluating requirements for feasibility, consistency, completeness, and clarity.
- **Specification**: Documenting requirements in formats like Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
- **Validation**: Ensuring the requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and can be implemented effectively.

### Importance in the SDLC:
1. ✅ **Clarity and Alignment**: Establishes a clear understanding between stakeholders and the development team.
2. ✅ **Reduced Rework**: Helps prevent misunderstandings and scope creep, saving time and cost during later phases.
3. ✅ **Improved Quality**: Accurate requirements lead to better-designed systems that fulfill user needs.
4. ✅ **Better Planning**: Enables accurate project estimation in terms of time, cost, and resources.
5. ✅ **Risk Reduction**: Identifies potential challenges and constraints early in the project.

In summary, requirement analysis is not just the first step of the SDLC—it's a critical one that heavily influences the success or failure of the entire software project.
